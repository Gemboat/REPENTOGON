# XML-File Documentations
REPENTOGON changes how some xmls are able to be loaded, from enabling content adding on xmls where it was not originally possible to adding new parameters with new attached functionality, on this section you'll be able to find the xmls that feature these sort of changes.

XML variables introduced in REPENTOGON are **not** case sensitive, so naming conventions like camelCase are allowed.
