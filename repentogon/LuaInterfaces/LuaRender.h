	/* Custom rendering: contexts.
	 *
	 * In custom rendering, a context is information tied to a render operation
	 * that can be used to determine what is being rendered.
	 * 
	 * For instance, a context composed of an EntityNPC*, AnimationState* and 
	 * AnimationLayer* gives information on the specific EntityNPC being 
	 * rendered, its animation data and the specific layer of animation that is
	 * being rendered. This information is not available in the recorded render
	 * operation (in the vertex / elements buffer) because it is useless to 
	 * perform the actual render. However, it is crucial for modders because this 
	 * will allow them to identify what is being drawn by a specific render 
	 * operation.
	 * 
	 * The system works as follows: whenever the game calls the glDrawElements 
	 * function, it fires a callback called MC_PRE_OPENGL_RENDER. This callback
	 * takes as parameter the elements array given to OpenGL, the currently bound
	 * shader's ID and a RenderContext (see below). 
	 *	- The elements array has the same meaning as in C OpenGL: an array containing
	 * indices of vertices in a related vertex array. In the context of Isaac the 
	 * elements array always contains 6 elements: 2 pairs of 3 elements each, which
	 * define two triangles that compose a rectangle (everything in Isaac is rendered
	 * as rectangles made of two adjacent triangles).
	 *	- The shader ID is the result of the glCreateProgram call. Native game shaders
	 * are enumerated in a table in Lua. User made shaders have an ID that is exposed 
	 * in Lua when they are built using the Renderer.Shader() function.
	 *	- The RenderContext contains information on all render operations registered 
	 * in the elements array. Each entry in the RenderContext corresponds to 6 values
	 * in the elements array. Entry index 'i' corresponds to values from '6 * i' (inclusive)
	 * to 6 * (i + 1) (exclusive).
	 * 
	 * In order to determine the context associated with a given render operation, we 
	 * hook the relevant functions on the path to the call to KAGE::Graphics::ImageBase::apply_data.
	 * This function is used to register the data relating to a render operation inside
	 * a KAGE::Graphics::ImageBase object. To give an example of how to get a context for 
	 * the rendering of an EntityNPC, we hook:
	 *	- void EntityNPC::Render() 
	 *	- void AnimationState::Render()
	 *	- void AnimationLayer::Render()
	 * The call to EntityNPC::Render gives information as to which entity in particular 
	 * is being rendered. The call to AnimationState::Render gives information on the 
	 * ANM2 of the EntityNPC. The call to AnimationLayer::Render gives information on 
	 * the specific layer being rendered. AnimationLayer::Render calls Image***::Render
	 * which finally arrives in ImageBase::apply_data. The context for an EntityNPC 
	 * is therefore made of three subcontexts: EntityNPC, AnimationState and AnimationLayer.
	 * Naturally, because animations may have multiple layers, the complete context 
	 * for an EntityNPC is a set of three-tuples, one for every layer, as every layer is
	 * rendered separately.
	 * 
	 * We expose a global variable, RenderContextQueue that contains the different subcontexts
	 * associated with a render operation. Each hook adds a subcontext in the queue. 
	 * During the call to apply_data the entire queue is added in an array associated
	 * with the vertex buffer in which the data is written. Therefore, each operation that 
	 * writes in this vertex buffer can be associated to a given context queue.
	 * 
	 * Types quick breakdown:
	 *	- Context is variant defining which C++ types can be used as a context. Start 
	 * there if you want to add a new type of context. For instance, Entity_NPC* is 
	 * a context.
	 *	- ContextType is an enumeration that must give an integral ID to every context 
	 * in Context. This is used to identify the type of a context in Lua.
	 *	- ContextQueue is a queue of subcontexts (Context). For instance, the ContextQueue
	 * of an EntityNPC contains an Entity_NPC*, an AnimationState* and an AnimationLayer*
	 * once it is recorded.
	 *	- ScoppedContext is a helper class to register a Context in the global ContextQueue.
	 *	- ContextArray is an array of ContextQueues. It is associated with a vertex buffer
	 * to give context to all operations recorded in the buffer.
	 *	- RenderContext is a map from a vertex buffer to a ContextArray. 
	 * 
	 * Globals quick breakdown:
	 *	- RenderContextQueue: a ContextQueue containing all the subcontexts of the current
	 * Render operation. Its content is inserted in the ContextArray of the current vertex
	 * buffer.
	 *	- ElementsRenderContext: a RenderContext mapping every elements buffer in the game
	 * to its RenderContext. Used in the glDrawElements hook to find the context of the
	 * buffer being rendered.
	 *	- VerticesRenderContext: similar as ElementsRenderContext but for vertex buffers.
	 * 
	 * Why does it work ?
	 * The elephant in the room is "What happens if a contextless operation appears ?". For 
	 * all its flaws, Isaac has a consistent render system. If the game initialized a 
	 * render operation, it does not switch contexts. If an EntityNPC starts rendering, then
	 * an EntityBomb won't start rendering before the EntityNPC has been rendered. Vertex buffers
	 * also don't store unrelated data, because they are tied to images. In other words, 
	 * an elements buffer cannot contain data related to an EntityNPC and an EntityBomb at
	 * the same time. An elements buffer can contain data related to the same kind of 
	 * EntityNPC, for instance all gapers in a room, but it cannot contain data related to 
	 * Gappers and Monstro at the same time because they use different images and therefore
	 * different buffers.
	 * If an operation with an unknown context appears (for instance pre rendering the
	 * walls of a room), then the operation is not given a context, and, by construction,
	 * cannot be mixed with other contexts, because an operation in a different context
	 * would use different buffers.
